  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract={With the increasing number of autonomous platforms in everyday life, forming coordinated teams of agents becomes vital. To solve this, we propose BERTeam, an algorithm inspired by Natural Language Processing. BERTeam trains a transformer-based deep neural network to select from a population of agents. It can integrate with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which evolves a diverse set of players to choose from. We evaluate BERTeam in Marine Capture-The-Flag, and find it learns non-trivial team compositions that outperform unknown opponents. In this setting, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, another team selection algorithm.},

title={\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s10846-024-02169-1}{UAV Routing for Enhancing the Performance of a Classifier-in-the-loop}},
journal={Journal of Intelligent {\&} Robotic Systems},
year={2024},
day={14},
volume={110},
number={134},
abstract={Some human-machine systems are designed so that machines (robots) gather and deliver data to remotely located operators (humans) through an interface to aid them in classification. The performance of a human as a (binary) classifier-in-the-loop is characterized by probabilities of correctly classifying objects (or points of interest) as a true target or a false target. These two probabilities depend on the time spent collecting information at a point of interest (POI), known as dwell time. The information gain associated with collecting information at a POI is then a function of dwell time and discounted by the revisit time, i.e., the duration between consecutive revisits to the same POI, to ensure that the vehicle covers all POIs in a timely manner. The objective of the routing problem for classification is to route the vehicles optimally, which is a discrete problem, and determine the optimal dwell time at each POI, which is a continuous optimization problem, to maximize the total discounted information gain while visiting every POI at least once. Due to the coupled discrete and continuous problem, which makes the problem hard to solve, we make a simplifying assumption that the information gain is discounted exponentially by the revisit time; this assumption enables one to decouple the problem of routing with the problem of determining optimal dwell time at each POI for a single vehicle problem. For the multi-vehicle problem, since the problem involves task partitioning between vehicles in addition to routing and dwell time computation, we provide a fast heuristic to obtain high-quality feasible solutions.},

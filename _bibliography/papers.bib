abstract={With the increasing number of autonomous platforms in everyday life, forming coordinated teams of agents becomes vital. To solve this, we propose BERTeam, an algorithm inspired by Natural Language Processing. BERTeam trains a transformer-based deep neural network to select from a population of agents. It can integrate with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which evolves a diverse set of players to choose from. We evaluate BERTeam in Marine Capture-The-Flag, and find it learns non-trivial team compositions that outperform unknown opponents. In this setting, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, another team selection algorithm.},

journal={Journal of Intelligent {\&} Robotic Systems},

volume={110},
number={134},
abstract={Some human-machine systems are designed so that machines (robots) gather and deliver data to remotely located operators (humans) through an interface to aid them in classification. The performance of a human as a (binary) classifier-in-the-loop is characterized by probabilities of correctly classifying objects (or points of interest) as a true target or a false target. These two probabilities depend on the time spent collecting information at a point of interest (POI), known as dwell time. The information gain associated with collecting information at a POI is then a function of dwell time and discounted by the revisit time, i.e., the duration between consecutive revisits to the same POI, to ensure that the vehicle covers all POIs in a timely manner. The objective of the routing problem for classification is to route the vehicles optimally, which is a discrete problem, and determine the optimal dwell time at each POI, which is a continuous optimization problem, to maximize the total discounted information gain while visiting every POI at least once. Due to the coupled discrete and continuous problem, which makes the problem hard to solve, we make a simplifying assumption that the information gain is discounted exponentially by the revisit time; this assumption enables one to decouple the problem of routing with the problem of determining optimal dwell time at each POI for a single vehicle problem. For the multi-vehicle problem, since the problem involves task partitioning between vehicles in addition to routing and dwell time computation, we provide a fast heuristic to obtain high-quality feasible solutions.},
